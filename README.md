## Why n8n Crypto Workflows?
- Automate common crypto tasks using battle-tested n8n nodes and HTTP calls
- Mix on-chain actions with off-chain notifications and AI triggers
- Use as templates for your own custom automations

Some workflows optionally use APIs from providers such as [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/), [Jupiter](https://jup.ag/), [AFKCrypto](https://www.afkcrypto.com), and others. Requirements are noted per workflow.

---

## Quick Start

2) In n8n, create a new workflow and simply copy and paste JSON code from [`/workflows`](./workflows) into your n8n workflow.  
3) Fill in credentials and environment variables (API keys, RPC URLs, secrets).  
4) Run with small values or on testnets first.  
5) Review logs and add timeouts/retries where appropriate.

## Verification Checklist
Before enabling any workflow with funds or production credentials:

- Confirm node parameters and environment variables are set correctly
- Validate addresses, chain IDs, token decimals, and slippage settings
- Add timeouts and bounded retries where requests may fail
- Log critical steps and verify success conditions, not just request completion
- Start with testnets or dust amounts; progressively increase only after review
- Ensure your jurisdiction permits the actions you automate
